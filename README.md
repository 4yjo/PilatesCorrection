# PilatesCorrection: Sending smartphone data to processing file

![gameicon](https://github.com/4yjo/PilatesCorrection/blob/main/Screenshot%202021-03-10%20at%2014.48.17.png?raw=true)

this app aims to analyse correct movement in pilates exercises by collecting sensor data from your android phone and sending it to a game running on your computer. The game is is written in prcessing3 (processing.org).

## how to play the game?

You need an android phone and a computer. On your computer you need to download Processing from https://processing.org/download/.

Now download the following two files: 
Pilates_Correction.pde
app-release.apk

connect your phone to your computer and drag the downloaded file app-release.apk on your android phone. Now it should be in your Apps.
Try to open it. If that worked well, you have to set the right server information. Click the menu button to go to settings. Here you need to enter your computer's ip adress.

Now run the processing file. Open Pilates_Correction.pde in Processing. Click the play button to run the game. A new window should open displaying a rocket.
Hit Let's go! on your smartphone (if it is running already, hit pause & Let's go). Now the rocket should move according to your smartphone movement :)
Install the smartphone on your lower back (some tape might be helpful) and hit space on your computer to start the game. Enjoy!
